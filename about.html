    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
    
Nasarawa Baptist Church, Jos came into being after the completion of First Baptist Church Adebayo Street in April 1971. A motion was moved that the Church at Oke-odo should not be left desolate, as such; the issue of renaming was debated upon. Some of the suggested names include: Nasarawa Gwom Baptist Church, Gwom Baptist Church, Oke-odo Baptist Church etc., After series of deliberation, the name Nasarawa Baptist Church, Jos was finally agreed on and the Church was henceforth addressed, named and called Nasarawa Baptist Church till date.
A decision was also reached on proper registration of members in March 1971.  This was to avoid dual membership. Dn. D. A. Dare was nominated to co-ordinate this proceeding. At that time, Rev. Olaniyan was still pasturing both Churches; morning service at Nasarawa Baptist Church  between 7:00 & 8:00 am and  later, First Baptist Church Adebayo, Street Jos.
Pastor J. A. Adegbite (now late Rev.) was called by First Baptist Church on 6th June 1971 and was inducted on 13th June 1971 as the Pastor of the Church.
He worked with the following people as the first Church Executive Council members:
<br>
Mr. Sokan James  (Church Secretary)
<br>
  Dn. J. P. Ladeji  (Treasurer)
  <br>
  Dn. G. O. Oke (Fin. Secretary)
  <br>
  Mr. O. Shogbeni (Organist)
  <br>
  Mr. E. E. Obasola (Sunday School Superintendent)
  <br>
  Mr. A. A. Oladapo (C.T.P)
  <br>
  Dns. J. O. Oladeji (W.M.U)
  <br>
  Mr Shittu A. O. (Choirmaster)
  <br>
  Mr Ayo Odelola (Auditor)



       The first service conducted by Pastor Adegbite was on 6th  June 1971.On his induction day, held on 13th June 1971, he requested that hymn 228 (Yoruba Hymnal) be rendered. This was at the instance of the number of worshippers that first worshiped in the church (two hundred and twenty eight) 228 old Yoruba Baptist hymnal
    Tire lemi se, mo ti gbohun Re
    O so ife re si mi
    Sugbon mo fe n de lapa igbagbo
    Kin le tubo sun mo O,
    Fani mo ra, mora Oluwa
    Si bagbelebu to ku
    Fani mora, mora, mora Oluwa
    Si beje re to ni yi
Thus began a new era after the formal organization of the Church on the 31st  October 1971
